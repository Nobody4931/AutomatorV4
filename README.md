# Automator v4 Rewrite
The coolest private Discord server management bot ever made

## Design Concepts

The mindset behind Automator v4 was to keep the usage of external dependencies to a minimum in order to lower the abstraction costs, allowing higher levels of efficiency to be achieved.

This involves:
- Raw usage of the Discord API ([Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro))
- Custom highly efficient binary data serialization format
- Modular design principles

## Notice

The code on this repository is unfinished because back in middle/high school when I wrote this app, I was solely working by myself, so I didn't have the foresight to commit my changes to GitHub, which I now regret, as a lot of my old projects have been lost.

The full code to Automator v3 is available [here](https://github.com/Nobody4931/AutomatorV3), but be warned as the code is very unorganized. However, it serves as a very good visualization of the improvement in my skills between major versions.
